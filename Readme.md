## Project Overview
In customer support environments, managing high volumes of inquiries is crucial for maintaining a positive customer experience. This system leverages NLP techniques to analyze and classify support tickets into predefined categories, automatically routing them to appropriate teams. The system is designed to work in real-time, ensuring faster ticket processing and allowing support teams to focus on resolving issues efficiently.

## Features
- **Automated Ticket Classification**: Classifies inquiries into categories like technical support, billing, and general information.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Routes tickets instantly to relevant teams, improving response times.
- **Keyword Insights**: Extracts keywords from tickets to highlight common issues and inform team training and product improvements.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Displays classified tickets, insights, and trends in an accessible interface for support teams.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `NLTK`/`spaCy`, `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`
- **Database**: SQL/NoSQL for storing ticket data and classified results
- **Dashboard**: Tableau or Power BI, or a custom dashboard using `Flask` or `Django`
